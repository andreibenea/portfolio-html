                <p>On this page, you'll find a collection of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and
                    creativity. Each project reflects my passion for problem-solving, design, and development. These
                    projects span various aspects of web development and software design, and I'm excited to share them
                    with you.</p>

                    was built and the challenges I overcame. If you have any questions or feedback, I'd love to hear
                    from you!</p>

                        I’m also working on new challenges and projects on <a href="https://www.boot.dev/"

                        Book — and possibly this portfolio in the future.
