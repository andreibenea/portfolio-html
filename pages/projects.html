                <h3>Welcome to My Projects Page!</h3>
                <p>On this page, you'll find a collection of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and
                    creativity. Each project reflects my passion for problem-solving, design, and development. These
                    projects span various aspects of web development and software design, and I'm excited to share them
                    with you.</p>
                <p>Take a look at the details below, and feel free to explore each project to learn more about how it
                    was built and the challenges I overcame. If you have any questions or feedback, I'd love to hear
                    from you!</p>

                    <a href="./projects/kreativ-sample.html">
                        <dt>Project 1: Kreativstorm</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Responsive multi-page marketing site built with semantic HTML and custom CSS. It includes a
                        fixed header with a CSS-based hamburger menu, flexbox layouts with media queries for all screen
                        sizes, and themed sections like Services, Industries, and Contact. Interactive pop-ups use HTML
                        anchors and the CSS :target selector for lightweight, JavaScript-free functionality.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/calculator.html">
                        <dt>Project 2: Calculator</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Browser-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It supports chained
                        operations, decimals, percent, sign inversion, and backspace, and prevents invalid actions like
                        dividing by zero. The app maintains internal state and updates the display in real time from
                        button clicks or full keyboard input, including operator highlighting and visual feedback.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/rock-paper-scissors.html">
                        <dt>Project 3: Rock-Paper-Scissors</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Rock Paper Scissors is a browser-based game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The
                        player chooses rock, paper, or scissors by clicking an icon, and the app instantly generates the
                        computer's move, decides the winner, and updates the running score on the page. The game logic
                        includes input validation, randomized computer choices, win/draw handling, and simple UI
                        feedback using alerts and live score counters in the DOM. This version also integrates
                        responsive layout, custom icons, and theme persistence (light/dark mode via localStorage), and
                        it was refactored from an earlier prompt-based console/alert version into an interactive
                        clickable interface.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/shopping-manager.html">
                        <dt>Project 4: Shopping Manager</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Desktop shopping list manager built in Python with Tkinter/ttk. Supports multiple named lists,
                        active list selection, and per-item quantities, with options to add, mark as done, or remove
                        items. Features a multi-page GUI (Home / Active List / All Lists) using a controller-based
                        navigation system, scrollable frames for dynamic updates, and in-memory data management for a
                        smooth, responsive user experience.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/digital-recipe-book.html">
                        <dt>Project 5: Digital Recipe Book</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Full-stack recipe management app built with Django and Django REST Framework. Includes user
                        authentication, CRUD functionality, image uploads, and RESTful API integration. Features a
                        responsive multi-page interface with reusable serializers and clean MVC architecture for
                        seamless front- and back-end interaction.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/helistrike.html">
                        <dt>Project 6: HeliStrike</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Arcade-style helicopter shooter built in Godot using GDScript. Features infinite vertical
                        scrolling, dynamic enemy and power-up spawning, health and score tracking, and layered parallax
                        backgrounds. Implements modular scripts with signals, timers, and scene instancing for smooth
                        gameplay, and a responsive UI with lives, score, and game-over states.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/static-site-generator-showcase.html">
                        <dt>Project 7: Static Site Generator</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Lightweight static site generator built in Python that converts Markdown files into fully
                        structured HTML pages. Implements a custom markdown parser with support for bold, italic, code
                        spans, links, images, headings, lists, and block quotes, using a TextNode/HTMLNode AST system
                        for clean HTML construction. Includes block-type detection, inline delimiter parsing with error
                        validation, and automatic newline collapsing for paragraphs. Recursively walks the content
                        directory, injects output into a reusable template, copies static assets, and builds a
                        deployable site.</dd>

                        I'm also continuously working on new challenges and projects on <a href="https://www.boot.dev/"
                            target="_blank" style="color: #666; text-decoration: underline;">Boot.dev</a>,
                        including an asteroid game written in Python and a toy version of an AI agent.
                        I'm also planning to set up a personal server on my Raspberry&nbsp;Pi to host the Digital Recipe
                        Book — and possibly this portfolio in the future.
