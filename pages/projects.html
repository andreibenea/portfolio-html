                <h3>Welcome to My Projects Page!</h3>
                <p>On this page, you'll find a collection of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and
                    creativity. Each project reflects my passion for problem-solving, design, and development. These
                    projects span various aspects of web development and software design, and I'm excited to share them
                    with you.</p>
                <p>Take a look at the details below, and feel free to explore each project to learn more about how it
                    was built and the challenges I overcame. If you have any questions or feedback, I'd love to hear
                    from you!</p>
                <dl>
                    <a href="./projects/kreativ-sample.html">
                        <dt>Project 1: Kreativstorm</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Kreativstorm is a responsive multi-page website built with HTML and CSS to showcase a fictional
                        consulting agency. It includes a fixed navigation bar with a mobile hamburger menu, animated
                        visuals, and multiple themed sections (“Industries,” “Services,” “Who We Are,” “Contact”). The
                        site also uses pure CSS pop-up panels triggered by anchor links (:target) to display detailed
                        content without JavaScript. Layout is handled with flexbox and custom media queries for desktop,
                        tablet, and mobile. The design focuses on a consistent brand style (dark hero section, accent
                        blue call-to-action banner, repeating footer) and a structured marketing feel.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/calculator.html">
                        <dt>Project 2: Calculator</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>The Calculator project is an interactive web calculator built in plain JavaScript with a custom
                        UI. The layout is rendered with semantic HTML and basic CSS, and the behavior is driven entirely
                        through event listeners on digit buttons, operator buttons, and keyboard input. The script
                        tracks calculator state internally (current value, pending operator, and second operand),
                        dynamically updates the display, and handles standard calculator features like addition,
                        subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal input, percent conversion, sign toggle, and
                        backspace editing. The UI also gives visual feedback by highlighting the active operator and
                        blocking divide-by-zero attempts with a warning.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/rock-paper-scissors.html">
                        <dt>Project 3: Rock-Paper-Scissors</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Rock Paper Scissors is a browser-based game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The
                        player chooses rock, paper, or scissors by clicking an icon, and the app instantly generates the
                        computer’s move, decides the winner, and updates the running score on the page. The game logic
                        includes input validation, randomized computer choices, win/draw handling, and simple UI
                        feedback using alerts and live score counters in the DOM. This version also integrates
                        responsive layout, custom icons, and theme persistence (light/dark mode via localStorage), and
                        it was refactored from an earlier prompt-based console/alert version into an interactive
                        clickable interface.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/shopping-manager.html">
                        <dt>Project 4: Shopping Manager</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Shopping Manager is a Python desktop application that lets the user create and manage multiple
                        shopping lists. The interface is built with Tkinter/ttk and uses a simple navigation system with
                        three views: Home (quick add), Active List (mark items done or remove them), and All Lists
                        (create, rename active list, delete lists). Each item stores both name and quantity, and
                        completed items are visually greyed out. The project was written in a single main.py using
                        classes (Application, MainPage, ActiveListPage, AllListsPage) and a shared controller to
                        coordinate UI state and list data.</dd>
                    <a href="./projects/digital-recipe-book.html">
                        <dt>Project 5: Digital Recipe Book</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>Full-stack recipe management platform built with Django and Django REST Framework. Implements
                        user authentication and CRUD operations for recipes and ingredients, supporting image uploads,
                        relational data models, and per-user data isolation. Features include a dynamic multi-page
                        interface with responsive templates, RESTful API endpoints for ingredient management, and form
                        handling for adding or editing recipes and linked ingredients. Uses clean MVC architecture,
                        reusable serializers, and a controller-based workflow for smooth front- and back-end
                        integration.</dd>

                        <dt>Project 6: HeliStrike</dt>
                    </a>
                    <dd>A fast-paced 2D helicopter shooter developed in Godot with custom GDScript logic. The game
                        includes infinite vertical scrolling, enemy and power-up spawning systems, projectile-based
                        combat with variable fire patterns, and animated explosions. Features structured scene hierarchy
                        and modular scripts using signals, timers, and PackedScene instancing. UI elements handle score,
                        lives, and restart controls, while responsive sound effects and animation blending create a
                        polished arcade experience.</dd>

                        I’m also working on new challenges and projects on <a href="https://www.boot.dev/"
                            target="_blank" style="color: #666; text-decoration: underline;">Boot.dev</a>,
                        including an asteroid game written in Python and a toy version of an AI agent.
                        I’m also planning to set up a personal server on my Raspberry&nbsp;Pi to host the Digital Recipe
                        Book — and possibly this portfolio in the future.
